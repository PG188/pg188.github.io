		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<p>I thoroughly enjoyed my role as a teaching assistant. It was immensely rewarding to impart new concepts and inspire students to strive for excellence. I've come to realize that being a teaching assistant significantly enhanced my grasp of the subject matter, as I needed to be prepared to address any inquiries.

			While instructional hours were fulfilling, the process of grading assignments and exams could be quite demanding. Nonetheless, it afforded me the opportunity to develop a keen eye for detail, enabling me to identify both major and minor errors in calculations.
			
			Overall, serving as a teaching assistant has been an invaluable learning experience for me.</p>
