		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<p>In my role, I was tasked with providing support to the IT team by undertaking various essential tasks. This primarily encompassed the repair of malfunctioning computers and printers, as well as the responsible disposal of outdated equipment. Additionally, I played a role in upgrading machines at CAPREIT's regional sites.

			One of my notable achievements during my tenure was the ability to handle and assist users efficiently through phone calls. This experience significantly contributed to the improvement of my communication skills, making me more adept at engaging with unfamiliar individuals and promptly addressing their needs.</p>
