		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<p>Working at wescam was both exciting and challenging. The pandemic played a huge role in my onboarding and toubleshooting process. Given the ever excalating health concerns, most of my work was done from home. this provided a completely new work environment for me and my colegues to adjust to. The work in itself was also suffeciently chalenging and pushed me to develop a deeper understanding of concept I had learned throughout my masters. Working in the advanced processing group, our focus was primarily on research and development. This posed a significant challenge as a lot of the data associated with the project was protected under the Controlled Goods Program (CGP). We were tasked with building robust algorithms while working with very limited requirements. Firthermore, it was interesting to see how security practices for development deffered between WESCAM and my last job at General Dynamics.</p>
