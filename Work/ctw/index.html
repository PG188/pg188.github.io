		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<p>In my role, I was responsible for providing support to the IT Support staff by undertaking various essential tasks. This typically included tasks such as repairing malfunctioning computers and printers, managing the disposal of outdated equipment, and assisting in the upgrade of machines at CAPREIT's regional sites.

			One of my most significant achievements during the year was acquiring the ability to efficiently handle phone calls and assist users remotely. This experience was highly valuable as it contributed significantly to the enhancement of my communication skills. I grew more comfortable in conversing with unfamiliar individuals and promptly addressing their needs, making it a rewarding professional development experience.</p>
