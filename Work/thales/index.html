		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<p>My time at THALES was truly enlightening. As part of the Research and Development department, I had the opportunity to contribute significantly to a high-impact project, resulting in an impressive 80% reduction in system testing time, showcasing my commitment to innovation and efficiency. I also successfully debugged C++ based full system regression testing software, ensuring its reliability and functionality. Taking on the role of training the Validation and Verification team in the proficient use of testing software not only fostered team collaboration but also facilitated skill development. Furthermore, my cross-functional collaboration led to the successful implementation of Jenkins and SonarQube for automated code checks, streamlining our development process. Additionally, I designed and developed a user-friendly Script Development environment for automated tests, enhancing overall efficiency. Lastly, I introduced effective revision control practices using GIT within the team, ensuring code integrity and effective version management. This experience provided valuable insights into how large firms initiate new software projects and maintain existing software systems.
