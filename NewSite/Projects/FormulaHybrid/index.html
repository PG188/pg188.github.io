            <P>The <a href="http://www.formula-hybrid.org/">Formula Hybrid Competition</a> takes place annually. It is regarded as the most complex and dynamic of the series of competitions hosted by the Society of Automotive Engineers for Collegiate Design. The purpose of the competition is to create the most efficient formula-style electric or plug-in hybrid race car. Each car competes in numerous events to evaluate performance and fuel efficiency. The competition emphasizes innovating new techniques to increase the performance of the vehicle. </P></div>

      <P>As a part of the <a href="http://www.formulahybrid.ca/#">McMaster Formula Hybrid team,</a> I was able to work on the software, improving the performance of the car. I was responsible for working on the algorithm, to detect and correct for the wheel slipping during acceleration, and breaking events of the vehicle. This was an excellent way to apply my knowledge of filters and real-time systems from class. Filters were used to reduce noise in the system and help compensate for the sampling frequency that was limited by the speed of the CAN network of the vehicle. Unfortunately, time constraints didn't allow for the proper testing of the software and a decision was made to not include the code during the competition to ensure the driver's safety.</P></div>
