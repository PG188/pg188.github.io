	    	<h1>FIRST <small class="text-muted">For inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology</small></h1>
			<p>FIRST is an international organization dedicated to inspiring kids of all ages to pursure STEM education.
				I have been a part of the organisation since 2007 and it has had a huge impact on my life.
				Through the organisation i have learned many technical and soft skills that have proved useful in my day to day life.
				Over the years I have also given back to the FIRST community through volunteering and mentorship.</p>

			<h1>Volunteering</h1>
			<p>
				I absolutely love volunttering! It is a great way to get to connect with other people while doing some good in the community.
				Over the past few years I have taken on many roles in the first community. from JR. FLL to FRC I work with kids in all the programs
				that FIRST has to offer. It is absolutely amazing to watch these little kids develop and grow. They are all extremely smart and
				often come up with innovate solutions to problems they encounter.

			<h1>Mentorship</h1>
			<p>Becoming a mentor is a very rewarding experience. I truely believe that teaching is the best way to truely understand 
				a topic. As a mentor I have been able to guide kids through their journey in FIRST and it has been a very rewarding 
				experience. In an effort to further inspire young minds, I have also helped start and guide some new FLL teams in the community.</p>
