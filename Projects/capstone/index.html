	    	<h2>Project Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this project is to create a smart, semi-autonomous, medical walker. The lists below
			include the primary and secondary goals identified for this project. These goals are the anticipated
			features for the target user within this design project.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Modify a standard walker to autonomously drive itself away to a ‘station’ when the user no longer requires the walker. The walker can autonomously track, navigate, and move to the a predefined ‘stations’.</li>
				<li>User can remotely prompt the walker to return to them from the product’s current location.</li>
				<li>The walker will be capable of actively braking upon detecting any rapid changes in elevation. For example, if a steep slope, stairs, or a sudden drop in the ground is detected.</li>
				<li>Maintain the primary functionalities of the common medical walker while augmenting its functionality by adding features in line with the above goals.</li>
			</ol>

		  		<p>In this project I took charge of all of the Mechanical components of the walker. This was an easy decision as most of my group mates were trianed in software and electrical systems. I also supported my team with any development and testing they conducted.</p>

		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<p>This was a very challenging project. having a team of 8 focused on a single school project can be a bit daunting. We divided responsibilities very early in the project so that things would run smoothly. Even then there were a few problems with communication as it was dificult to have group meetings, given our schedule. In retrospect, a tool like trello would have made it much easier to coordinate tasks. Ultimate the project ended well and we had an electric walker capable of driving around the room while detecting obsticles.</p>
