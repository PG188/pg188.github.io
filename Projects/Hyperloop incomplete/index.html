			<p>
				The <a href="http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop">Hyperloop comptition</a> 
				organised by <a href="http://www.spacex.com">Space X</a> with an aim to 
				help accelerate the development of the Hyperloop protoype. Hosted at Texas
				A&M University, the event invited 120 schools to put forward thier innovative
				ideas and designs to the test. Each team's plan was judged by a pannel of 
				highly qualified engineers and employees from <a href="http://www.spacex.com">Space X</a> and 
				<a href="https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/models">Tesla</a>.

		  		<h2>My Role</h2>
			  	<P>
					My primary role on the team was to design and render the team's proposed Hyperloop Pod.
					A part of my job was to ensure that all the parts and subsystems has suffecient space.
					Furthermore I had to ensire that none of the moving components would interfear with each
					other and what safety measures would be in place to prevent it. The most dificult challenge was to 
					add all the features the team wanted in the dimensions specified provided by
					the organisers while ensuring theere was suffecient space for the passengers to be confortably seated.
					Part of my job involved analysing conponents to determine how they would perform
					with various amounts of stress and strain. This was done using the 
					<a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/features/simulation-visualization/stress-analysis">
					stress analysis</a> tools provided in <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview">
					Autodesk Inventor</a>.

		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<p>It was amazing being a part of such a forward thinking group. The energy was almost electric when we worked. Everyone was passionate about all the new technologies comming out of SpaceX and Tesla. We all jumped at the opportunity to learn a lot more while being a part of such a futuristic competition. Working with our Project Supervisors we learned a lot about the mas transportation industry and all the things that needed considering when designing a rail system. We faced a lot of challenges at the competition as our car was broken into and electronics stolen. We frantically attentped to piece together the presentation minutes before our deadline and managed to present. Ever since I have always remembered to back up my documents online aswell as keep multiple copies in USBs as backup. A lot of lessions about protecting our data were learned the lard way in this project but it was still a great experience overall.</p>
