	    	<h2>Project Description</h2>
			<p><a href="http://ecocar3.org/">EcoCAR 3</a> represented the latest installment in the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Vehicle Technology Competition (AVTC) series. AVTC stood as a distinctive collaboration uniting government, industry, and academic partners, pooling their resources to investigate sustainable transportation solutions. Sixteen North American universities embarked on the challenge of transforming a Chevrolet Camaro into a hybrid-electric vehicle over a span of four years.</p>

		  		<h2>My Role</h2>
				<p>In this project, there were various roles, with each team responsible for designing, simulating, modifying, and testing the vehicle powertrains. During the year I was involved, my focus was on the low-level software development of the car. I assisted in programming new functionalities and, in the process, gained valuable insights into the car's development process. Throughout the year, I applied my knowledge of C# to program Freescale processors for specific tasks.

					Prior to coding, my team and I meticulously prepared the necessary documentation. This involved creating interface specifications and test scenarios to validate the logic before code compilation. This approach allowed us to implement sound software development practices, ensuring efficient and effective code construction.</p>

		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<p>While this project was truly remarkable, I personally felt somewhat underprepared for my role. Being a second-year student at the time, I possessed limited knowledge, which led me to dedicate a significant portion of my time to learning about crucial concepts like CAN and I2C, among others. This experience served as an invaluable learning opportunity, reshaping my approach to project management as I progressed in my academic and professional journey.		</p>
