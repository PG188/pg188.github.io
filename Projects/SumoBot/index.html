	    	<h2>Project Description</h2>
			<p>The McMaster SumoBot group was founded by Vinay Yuvashankar as an effort to help the Mechatronics Engineering students at McMaster to gain more practical experience in the field. Over the past two years I have competed in and helped organise the event. The event helped me learn a lot about how a club at McMaster operates. I got first had experience in filing out the necessary paperwork and creating proper documentation to ensure that others can perform my duties once I have graduated.</p>

		  		<h2>My Role</h2>
		  		<p>I was the Vice Presidents of Parts in the club. I was responsible for creating an economic kit of parts for each team that competed. I had to stay in regular communication with the Vice President of Finance and the President of the club to ensure that the parts being ordered were within the clubs budget. While performing my duties I learned about the many hardware and electronics distributors in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. My primary focus at the club was to ensure that all the teams received quality parts sufficient to build an average robot.</p>
