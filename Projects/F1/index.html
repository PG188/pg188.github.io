	    	<h2>Project Description</h2>
			<p>This was one of the most challenging competitions in terms of coordinating resources among team members. I was part of the only collaborative team in the regional competition. This meant that students from different schools collaborated to work as a single team. This posed a challenge because, unlike most teams, it was difficult for us to host regular meetings to communicate the teamâ€™s progress. This hurdle was overcome by dividing the work into three roles: manufacturing, marketing, and outreach. The team agreed to collaborate on the overall design of the F1 car, as it was the most important part of the competition.</p>

		  		<h2>Design</h2>
				<p>The car was modeled to have a larger body than most F1 cars. It was designed based on the Boxy Fish, which had one of the lowest drag coefficients among fish. As can be seen in Figure 6, the shape of the body reduced the low-pressure zone behind the F1 car. This low pressure was further diminished through a hole at the bottom of the car. This is indicated by the green (reduced low pressure) markers in the wind tunnel results.</p>
