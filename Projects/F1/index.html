			<P>This  was the one of the most challenging competitions in terms of coordinating  resources between team members. I was a part of the only collaboration team in  the regional competition. This meant that students from different schools all  collaborated to work as a single team. This posed a challenge as unlike most  teams it was difficult for us to host regular meetings to communicate the  team&rsquo;s progress. This hurdle was overcome by dividing the work into 3 rolls.  These were manufacturing, marketing and outreach. The team agreed to  collaborate on the overall design of the F1 car as it was the most important  part of the competition.</P>

            	The car was modeled to have a larger body than  most F1 cars. It was a designed based on the Boxy Fish that had one of the  lowest drag coefficients in fish. As can be seen in Figure 6, the shape of the  body reduced the low pressure zone behind the f1 car. This low pressure was  also further reduced through a hole at eh bottom of the car. This can be  indicated by the green (reduced low pressure) marks in the wind tunnel result. <br>
